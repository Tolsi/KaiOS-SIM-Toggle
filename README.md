# KaiOS-SIM-Toggle
This small application that allows you to turn on and off the second SIM card on your phone without using adb.

You can download ZIP app in the Releases section.

## Note

By default, the application assumes that the second SIM card is enabled. If you have already turned off the second sim card, you can turn it off again in the application without rebooting and it will remember it. This will allow you to turn it on later from it.

# Build

Just run `./pack.sh` from the root, it will create ZIP archive with all you need to install it into your KaiOS device using [OmniJB](http://omnijb.831337.xyz) or [GerdaPkg](https://gerda.tech)
